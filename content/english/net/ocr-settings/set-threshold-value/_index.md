AsposeOcr api = new AsposeOcr();
```

### Step 3: Recognize Image with Custom Threshold

```csharp
// Recognize image with a specific threshold value (e.g., 230)
RecognitionResult result = api.RecognizeImage(dataDir + "sample.png", new RecognitionSettings
{
    ThresholdValue = 230
});
```

### Step 4: Display Recognized Text

```csharp
// Display the recognized text
Console.WriteLine(result.RecognitionText);
```

### Step 5: Confirm Successful Execution

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("SetThresholdValue executed successfully");
```
