```

## Step 4: Recognition Settings

Configure recognition settings according to your requirements, whether using default or custom settings:

```csharp
RecognitionSettings settings = new RecognitionSettings
{
    // Specify your recognition settings here
};
```

## Step 5: Perform Image Recognition

Execute the image recognition process using the specified image and settings:

```csharp
RecognitionResult result = api.RecognizeImage(fullPath, settings);
```

## Step 6: Print Recognition Result

Display the recognition results, including text, skew, paragraphs, areas, lines, choices, JSON representation, and warnings:

```csharp
PrintRecognitionResult(result);
```
