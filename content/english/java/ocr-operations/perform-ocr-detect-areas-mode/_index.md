## Introduction

In the ever-evolving world of technology, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) plays a pivotal role in extracting valuable information from images. Aspose.OCR for Java provides a powerful solution for OCR, enabling developers to harness the potential of text recognition seamlessly. This tutorial will guide you through the process of performing OCR with Detect Areas Mode using Aspose.OCR for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
- Aspose.OCR for Java: Download and install the Aspose.OCR library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/java/).
- Document for OCR: Prepare an image document (e.g., "Receipt.jpg") that contains the text you want to extract.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages for using Aspose.OCR. Here's an example:

```java
package com.aspose.ocr.examples.OcrFeatures;

import com.aspose.ocr.AsposeOCR;
import com.aspose.ocr.DetectAreasMode;
import com.aspose.ocr.Language;
import com.aspose.ocr.License;
import com.aspose.ocr.RecognitionResult;
import com.aspose.ocr.RecognitionResult.LinesResult;
import com.aspose.ocr.RecognitionSettings;
import com.aspose.ocr.examples.License.SetLicense;
import com.aspose.ocr.examples.Utils;

import java.awt.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the OCR Operation

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// The image path
String file = dataDir + "Receipt.jpg";

// Create AsposeOCR instance
AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();

// Set recognition options
RecognitionSettings settings = new RecognitionSettings();
settings.setDetectAreasMode(DetectAreasMode.PHOTO);
```

In this step, we initialize the OCR operation, specify the image file path, and configure the recognition settings to use Detect Areas Mode.

## Step 2: Perform OCR and Retrieve Results

```java
// Get result object
RecognitionResult result = null;
try {
    result = api.RecognizePage(file, settings);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Execute the OCR operation using the specified image and settings. The result object will contain the extracted text and other relevant information.

## Step 3: Print OCR Results

```java
// Print result
printResult(result);
```

Define a method (`printResult`) to display various aspects of the OCR result, such as text, skew, paragraphs, lines, character choices, warnings, JSON, and spell-check corrected text.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully performed OCR with Detect Areas Mode using Aspose.OCR for Java. This powerful tool opens up a world of possibilities for extracting and manipulating text from images effortlessly.
