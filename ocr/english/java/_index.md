# Extract Text from Image with Aspose.OCR for Java

## Introduction

If you need to **extract text from image** files in a Java application, Aspose.OCR for Java offers a powerful, easy‑to‑integrate solution. Whether you’re processing scanned invoices, digitizing printed forms, or building a searchable document archive, this tutorial collection will guide you step‑by‑step through the most common scenarios. You’ll learn how to set up your license, work with different image formats, and fine‑tune OCR settings for the best accuracy.

## Quick Answers
- **What does Aspose.OCR do?** It converts raster images, PDFs, and TIFFs into searchable, editable text.
- **Can I extract text from image files of any format?** Yes – JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF, and more are supported.
- **Is a license required for production?** A free trial works for development; a paid license removes evaluation limits.
- **How can I boost OCR accuracy?** Use language selection, deskewing, and area detection features.
- **Does Aspose.OCR work with PDF files?** Absolutely – you can **recognize PDF with OCR** and extract text from each page.

## What is “extract text from image” in Java?

Extracting text from an image means applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms to convert visual characters into machine‑readable strings. In Java, Aspose.OCR provides a high‑level API that abstracts the complex image preprocessing steps, letting you focus on business logic instead of low‑level pixel manipulation.

## Why use Aspose.OCR for Java?

- **High accuracy** across multiple languages and fonts.  
- **Built‑in image enhancement** (deskew, noise removal, area detection).  
- **Seamless PDF/TIFF support** – you can **recognize PDF with OCR** without external converters.  
- **No native dependencies** – pure Java, easy to embed in any JVM‑based project.  

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher installed.  
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management.  
- An Aspose.OCR for Java license (or a temporary trial key).

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use Aspose.OCR for Java in a commercial product?**  
A: Yes. Once you obtain a paid license, you can embed the library in any commercial application without restrictions.

**Q: Does the library support multi‑page PDF OCR out of the box?**  
A: Absolutely. By enabling PDF recognition mode, Aspose.OCR processes each page automatically and returns the combined text.

**Q: How do I improve OCR results on low‑resolution scans?**  
A: Apply image preprocessing options such as `setDeskew(true)`, increase contrast, and enable `detectAreas()` to focus on text blocks.

**Q: Is there a way to extract only specific regions from an image?**  
A: Yes. Use the `detectAreas()` method to define rectangular zones, then run OCR on those zones individually.

**Q: What languages are supported for text extraction?**  
A: Over 100 languages are supported, including English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, and many more. Set the desired language via `setLanguage()`.
