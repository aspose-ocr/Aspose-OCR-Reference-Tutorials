# Getting Rectangles with Text Areas in Aspose.OCR

## Introduction

Are you looking to integrate powerful optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities into your Java application? Aspose.OCR for Java is your go-to solution for accurate and efficient text extraction from images. This tutorial will guide you through the process of getting rectangles with text areas using Aspose.OCR, helping you harness the full potential of this Java OCR library.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
- Aspose.OCR for Java Library: Download and set up the Aspose.OCR library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/java/).

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages to leverage the functionalities of Aspose.OCR:

```java
package com.aspose.ocr.examples.OcrFeatures;

import com.aspose.ocr.AreasType;
import com.aspose.ocr.AsposeOCR;
import com.aspose.ocr.examples.License.SetLicense;
import com.aspose.ocr.examples.Utils;

import java.awt.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Ensure that you have a Java project ready, and the Aspose.OCR library is integrated.

## Step 2: Define Document Directory and Image Path

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// The image path
String imagePath = dataDir + "p3.png";
```

## Step 3: Create Aspose.OCR Instance

```java
// Create Aspose.OCR instance
AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();
```

## Step 4: Recognize Text in the Image

```java
try {
    // Recognize page by full path to file
    String result = api.RecognizePage(imagePath);
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Step 5: Get Rectangles with Text Areas

```java
// Get rectangles with text areas in the image.
ArrayList<Rectangle> rectResult = api.getTextAreas(imagePath, AreasType.PARAGRAPHS, true);

// Print each text area rectangle
for (Rectangle r : rectResult) {
    System.out.println("Text area:" + r);
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to integrate Aspose.OCR for Java into your project to extract text from images efficiently. Aspose.OCR simplifies OCR tasks, providing accurate results for a seamless user experience.
