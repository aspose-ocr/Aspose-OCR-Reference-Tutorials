# Preparing Rectangles for OCR in Aspose.OCR

## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of technology, extracting text from images has become a crucial task, opening doors to countless possibilities. Aspose.OCR for Java stands out as a powerful tool, simplifying the intricate process of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the essential steps to harness the potential of Aspose.OCR for Java, allowing you to seamlessly integrate text recognition into your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before delving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Aspose.OCR for Java requires a Java environment. Download and install the latest JDK from the Oracle website.

- Aspose.OCR for Java Library: Acquire the Aspose.OCR for Java library from the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/java/). Follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/ocr/java/).

- Development Environment: Set up your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to begin coding along with us.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, import the necessary packages to make Aspose.OCR functionalities available. Use the following snippet at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
package com.aspose.ocr.examples.OcrFeatures;

import com.aspose.ocr.AsposeOCR;
import com.aspose.ocr.examples.License.SetLicense;
import com.aspose.ocr.examples.Utils;

import java.awt.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

## Step 1: Set Up License

```java
SetLicense.main(null);
```

Ensure you've set up the license for Aspose.OCR by calling the `SetLicense` method. This step is vital to unleash the full potential of the library.

## Step 2: Define Document Directory and Image Path

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String imagePath = dataDir + "p.png";
```

Specify the document directory and image path where your image for OCR processing is located.

## Step 3: Create Aspose.OCR Instance

```java
AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();
```

Instantiate the Aspose.OCR class to create an API instance.

## Step 4: Prepare Rectangles with Texts

```java
ArrayList<Rectangle> rectArray = new ArrayList<Rectangle>();
rectArray.add(new Rectangle(138, 352, 2033, 537));
rectArray.add(new Rectangle(147, 890, 2033, 1157));
rectArray.add(new Rectangle(923, 2045, 465, 102));
rectArray.add(new Rectangle(104, 2147, 2076, 819));
```

Define rectangles with texts to indicate the areas where OCR should be applied.

## Step 5: Perform OCR Recognition

```java
try {
    String result = api.RecognizePage(imagePath, rectArray);
    System.out.println("Result with rect: " + result);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

Finally, execute the OCR recognition using the defined rectangles. The recognized text will be printed to the console.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully navigated through the steps of integrating Aspose.OCR for Java into your project. This versatile tool empowers you to extract text from images with ease, offering endless possibilities for your applications.
