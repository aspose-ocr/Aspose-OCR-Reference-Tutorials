# Recognizing Lines in Aspose.OCR for Java

## Introduction

Are you looking to enhance your Java application with powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities? Look no further! Aspose.OCR for Java is a cutting-edge OCR library that allows you to seamlessly integrate OCR functionality into your Java applications. In this tutorial, we will focus on recognizing lines in images using Aspose.OCR for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the exciting world of OCR with Aspose, let's ensure you have everything set up:

1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have a Java development environment set up on your system.

2. Aspose.OCR for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.OCR for Java library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/java/).

3. Image for OCR: Prepare an image containing text that you want to recognize. Adjust the `imagePath` variable in the example code with the path to your image.

Now that you have your prerequisites in order, let's move on to importing packages and breaking down the example into multiple steps.

## Import Packages

In your Java class, import the necessary packages for Aspose.OCR:

```java
package com.aspose.ocr.examples.OcrFeatures;

import com.aspose.ocr.AsposeOCR;
import com.aspose.ocr.RecognitionResult;
import com.aspose.ocr.RecognitionSettings;
import com.aspose.ocr.examples.Utils;

import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Set Document Directory

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace "Your Document Directory" with the path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Set Image Path

```java
// The image path
String imagePath = dataDir + "0001460985.Jpeg";
```

Adjust the image path to point to the location of your image.

## Step 3: Create API Instance

```java
// Create API instance
AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();
```

Instantiate the AsposeOCR class to create an OCR API instance.

## Step 4: Configure Recognition Settings

```java
RecognitionSettings settings = new RecognitionSettings();
settings.setRecognizeSingleLine(true);
```

Configure recognition settings according to your requirements. In this example, we set it to recognize a single line.

## Step 5: Perform OCR Recognition

```java
RecognitionResult result = api.RecognizePage(imagePath, settings);
System.out.println("File: " + imagePath);
System.out.println("Result line: " + result.recognitionText);
```

Execute OCR recognition on the specified image and output the recognition result.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate line recognition capabilities into your Java application using Aspose.OCR.
