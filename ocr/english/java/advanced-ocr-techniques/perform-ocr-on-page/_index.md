# Performing OCR on Specific Page in Aspose.OCR

## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on a specific page using Aspose.OCR for Java. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of setting up, importing necessary packages, and executing the code to extract text from an image with ease.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A basic understanding of Java programming.
- Aspose.OCR for Java installed. If not, download it from the [Aspose.OCR for Java download page](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/java/).
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse installed on your machine.

## Import Packages

In your Java project, start by importing the required packages. Ensure you have the Aspose.OCR library properly integrated. The following code snippet demonstrates the necessary imports:

```java
package com.aspose.ocr.examples.OcrFeatures;

import com.aspose.ocr.AsposeOCR;
import com.aspose.ocr.examples.License.SetLicense;
import com.aspose.ocr.examples.Utils;

import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Licensing

Before using Aspose.OCR, it's crucial to set up the licensing. Uncomment the `SetLicense.main(null)` line in your code. Ensure your license is valid and placed appropriately.

## Step 2: Specify Document Directory and Image Path

Define the directory where your document is stored and the path to the image you want to process. Update the `dataDir` and `imagePath` variables accordingly.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
String imagePath = dataDir + "p3.png";
```

## Step 3: Create AsposeOCR Instance

Instantiate the AsposeOCR class to utilize its OCR functionalities.

```java
AsposeOCR api = new AsposeOCR();
```

## Step 4: Recognize Page

Use the `RecognizePage` method to extract text from the specified image.

```java
try {
    String result = api.RecognizePage(imagePath);
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
