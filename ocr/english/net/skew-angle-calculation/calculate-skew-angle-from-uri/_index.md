## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.OCR for .NET! In this comprehensive tutorial, we will delve into the intricacies of utilizing Aspose.OCR for .NET to calculate the skew angle from a URI in OCR image recognition. This powerful tool opens up new possibilities in optical character recognition, making the process smoother and more efficient.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, let's ensure you have everything in place:

### Import Namespaces

Ensure you have the necessary namespaces imported into your project. This step is crucial for seamless integration with Aspose.OCR for .NET. Include the following namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.OCR;
using Aspose.OCR.Models.PreprocessingFilters;
```

Now, let's break down each example into multiple steps.

## Step 1: Initialize Aspose.OCR

```csharp
// Initialize an instance of AsposeOcr
AsposeOcr api = new AsposeOcr();
```

Here, we create an instance of AsposeOcr, laying the foundation for subsequent operations.

## Step 2: Calculate Angle

```csharp
// Calculate Angle
float angle = api.CalculateSkewFromUri("https://i.stack.imgur.com/0A4M9.png");
```

In this step, we utilize the CalculateSkewFromUri method to determine the skew angle of the image located at the specified URI.

## Step 3: Display the Result

```csharp
// Display the result
Console.WriteLine(angle);
```

Print the calculated angle to the console, providing valuable insights into the skew of the OCR image.

### Step 4: Conclusion

```csharp
// ExEnd:1

Console.WriteLine("CalculateSkewAngleFromUri executed successfully");
```

Here, we mark the end of our example, indicating successful execution.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully navigated through the process of calculating skew angles using Aspose.OCR for .NET. This tutorial has equipped you with the skills to enhance your OCR image recognition projects.
