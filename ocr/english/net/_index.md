# How to Calculate OCR with Aspose.OCR for .NET

## Introduction

If you’re looking to **how to calculate OCR** results accurately in your .NET projects, you’ve come to the right place. In this guide we’ll walk through the most common scenarios—skew angle correction, image and drawing recognition, text extraction, configuration, and performance tuning. By the end you’ll know exactly **how to extract text** from a variety of image sources and how to **optimize OCR** for speed and accuracy.

## Quick Answers
- **What is the first step to calculate OCR?** Align the image and correct its skew angle.  
- **Which feature extracts text from drawings?** The Image and Drawing Recognition module.  
- **How do I improve OCR speed?** Use preprocessing filters and fine‑tune OCR Settings.  
- **Can I select a specific language?** Yes—use the OCR language selection option.  
- **Do I need a license for production?** A valid Aspose license is required for commercial use.

## How to Calculate OCR: Skew Angle Calculation

Skewed documents are a common source of recognition errors. This section shows you **how to calculate OCR** accuracy by detecting and correcting the skew angle before feeding the image to the engine. Follow the step‑by‑step instructions to ensure the text lines are perfectly horizontal, which dramatically boosts extraction quality.

## Image and Drawing Recognition

Extracting information isn’t limited to plain text. With Aspose.OCR you can also recognize shapes, diagrams, and handwritten annotations. This capability is essential when you need to **extract text from images** that contain mixed content such as forms or engineering drawings.

## Text Recognition

Accurate character detection is the heart of any OCR workflow. Here we dive into the options for obtaining recognition choices, raw results, and JSON‑formatted outputs. You’ll learn **how to extract text** efficiently and how to handle multilingual documents using the built‑in language selection feature.

## OCR Configuration

Configuring the engine correctly can save you hours of debugging. We cover archive handling, folder processing, **OCR language selection**, and list operations that let you tailor the OCR run to your exact needs.

## OCR Optimization

Performance matters, especially with large batches. This guide explains how to prepare image rectangles, apply preprocessing filters, run spell‑checking on results, and save multi‑page OCR outputs—all proven ways to **how to optimize OCR** for both accuracy and speed.

## OCR Settings

Fine‑tuning settings gives you control over accuracy, speed, and custom behavior. Learn which parameters to adjust for different image qualities, languages, and layout complexities.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How can I improve OCR accuracy on low‑resolution images?**  
A: Apply image preprocessing (de‑noise, binarization) and correct the skew angle before recognition.

**Q: Is it possible to recognize multiple languages in a single document?**  
A: Yes—use the OCR language selection feature to specify a comma‑separated list of languages.

**Q: What is the best way to extract text from PDFs that contain scanned pages?**  
A: Convert each PDF page to an image, correct skew, then run Aspose.OCR with appropriate language settings.

**Q: Can I run OCR in a multi‑threaded environment?**  
A: Absolutely. Instantiate separate OCR objects per thread or use the thread‑safe static methods provided by Aspose.OCR.

**Q: Does Aspose.OCR support handwriting recognition?**  
A: Basic handwriting is supported, but results may vary; consider additional preprocessing for better outcomes.
