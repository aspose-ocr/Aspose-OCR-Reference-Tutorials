# Extract Text from Image Using Aspose.OCR .NET

## Introduction

In this comprehensive guide, you’ll discover how to **extract text from image** files using Aspose.OCR for .NET. Whether you need to pull text from a single line, an entire paragraph, or a continuous image stream, this tutorial walks you through each scenario with clear, step‑by‑step instructions. Let’s dive in and see how you can seamlessly integrate OCR capabilities into your .NET applications.

## Quick Answers
- **What does Aspose.OCR do?** It extracts text from image files, PDFs, and streams with high accuracy.  
- **Can I extract text from a single line?** Yes – use the “Getting Rectangles for Lines” tutorial.  
- **Is paragraph extraction supported?** Absolutely; see the “Getting Rectangles for Paragraphs” guide.  
- **Do I need a license for production?** A commercial license is required for production use; a free trial is available.  
- **Which .NET versions are compatible?** .NET Framework 4.5+, .NET Core 3.1+, .NET 5/6/7.

## How to extract text from image with Aspose.OCR?
Aspose.OCR provides a flexible API that lets you target specific text areas, work with image streams, or run a full‑scale OCR pass. By focusing on the right method for your scenario, you can improve performance and accuracy while keeping your code clean.

## Getting Rectangles for Lines in OCR Image Recognition

In many applications you only need the text that appears on a single line—think of scanning receipts or extracting labels. The tutorial on [Getting Rectangles for Lines](./get-rectangles-for-lines/) shows you how to isolate each line’s bounding box and then run OCR on that region alone.

## Getting Rectangles for Paragraphs in OCR Image Recognition

When dealing with documents, extracting whole paragraphs is often more useful than line‑by‑line processing. The guide **[Getting Rectangles for Paragraphs](./get-rectangles-for-paragraphs/)** walks you through detecting paragraph boundaries and feeding those regions to the OCR engine for accurate text retrieval.

## Recognizing Image from Stream in OCR Image Recognition

Processing images directly from streams (for example, when files are uploaded via a web API) avoids the overhead of saving temporary files. The **[Recognize Image from Stream](./recognize-image-from-stream/)** tutorial demonstrates how to pass a `Stream` object to Aspose.OCR and obtain the extracted text instantly.

## Recognizing Image without Text Area Detection in OCR Image Recognition

Sometimes you want to run OCR on an entire image without first locating text zones. The tutorial **[Aspose.OCR for .NET](./recognize-image-without-text-area-detection/)** explains how to perform a full‑image scan, which is handy for quick checks or when the layout is unpredictable.

## Recognizing Line in OCR Image Recognition

If you need to focus on a specific line—perhaps to validate a serial number or a barcode label—**[Recognize Line](./recognize-line/)** provides a concise walkthrough for isolating and reading that line only.

## Perform OCR on Image in OCR Image Recognition

This section covers the core operation of **perform OCR on image** files. By following the steps in this tutorial, you’ll learn how to configure the OCR engine, select the appropriate language, and retrieve clean, searchable text from any supported image format.

In conclusion, Aspose.OCR for .NET offers a rich set of tutorials that help developers master every aspect of OCR image recognition—from lines and paragraphs to full‑image streams. Explore the links below to start building robust text‑extraction features today.
