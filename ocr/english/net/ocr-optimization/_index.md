## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I extract text from image files that contain multiple languages?**  
A: Yes, Aspose.OCR supports a wide range of languages and can be configured to recognize mixed‑language content.

**Q: How does preprocessing improve accuracy?**  
A: Filters such as binarization, despeckle, and deskew clean the image, reducing noise and aligning text, which leads to higher recognition rates.

**Q: Is there a limit to the number of pages I can process in one run?**  
A: There is no hard limit; performance depends on system resources. For very large batches, consider processing pages in chunks.

**Q: Can I integrate the OCR engine into a cloud‑based service?**
