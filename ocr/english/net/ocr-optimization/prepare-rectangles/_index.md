# Prepare Rectangles in OCR Image Recognition

## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) plays a pivotal role in transforming images into machine-readable text. Aspose.OCR for .NET stands out as a robust solution for developers seeking seamless integration of OCR capabilities into their .NET applications. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the process of preparing rectangles in OCR image recognition using Aspose.OCR for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A working knowledge of .NET development.
- Aspose.OCR for .NET library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/net/).
- A basic understanding of image recognition concepts.

## Import Namespaces

Let's begin by importing the necessary namespaces to kickstart our OCR journey:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.OCR;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

Begin by specifying the directory where your documents are stored. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your documents.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Initialize an instance of AsposeOcr
AsposeOcr api = new AsposeOcr();
```

## Step 2: Recognize Image with Multiple Rectangles

In this step, we'll demonstrate how to recognize text from an image using multiple rectangles. Follow these sub-steps:

### 2.1 Define Rectangles

```csharp
List<Rectangle> rects = new List<Rectangle>()
{
    new Rectangle(138, 352, 2033, 537),
    new Rectangle(147, 890, 2033, 1157),
    new Rectangle(923, 2045, 465, 102),
    new Rectangle(104, 2147, 2076, 819)
};
```

### 2.2 Perform OCR Recognition

```csharp
// first case
List<string> listResult = api.RecognizeImage(dataDir + "sample.png", rects);

// Display the recognized text
foreach (string s in listResult)
{
    Console.WriteLine(s);
}
```

## Step 3: Recognize Image with Recognition Settings

In this step, we'll showcase an alternative method using RecognitionSettings for image recognition:

### 3.1 Define Recognition Settings

```csharp
RecognitionResult result = api.RecognizeImage(dataDir + "sample.png", new RecognitionSettings
{
    RecognitionAreas = rects
});
```

### 3.2 Display Recognized Text

```csharp
// Display the recognized text
foreach (string s in result.RecognitionAreasText)
{
    Console.WriteLine(s);
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully navigated the process of preparing rectangles in OCR image recognition using Aspose.OCR for .NET. This guide empowers you to integrate OCR seamlessly into your .NET applications, enhancing their text recognition capabilities.
