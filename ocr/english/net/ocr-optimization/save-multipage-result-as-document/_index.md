Now that you're all set, let's jump into the step-by-step guide.

## Import Namespaces

Begin your project by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using Aspose.OCR;
```

## Step 1: Set Your Document Directory

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory.

## Step 2: Initialize Aspose.OCR

```csharp
// Initialize an instance of AsposeOcr
AsposeOcr api = new AsposeOcr();
```

Create an instance of `AsposeOcr` to access the OCR functionalities.

## Step 3: Recognize Images

```csharp
// Recognize image
List<RecognitionResult> result = api.RecognizeMultipleImages(
    new List<string> { dataDir + "sample.png", dataDir + "sample_bad.png" },
    new RecognitionSettings { }
).ToList();
```

Utilize Aspose.OCR to recognize text from multiple images. Adjust the file paths according to your image files.

## Step 4: Save Results in Preferred Formats

```csharp
// Save the result in your preferred format
AsposeOcr.SaveMultipageDocument(RunExamples.GetDataDir_OCR()+"sample.docx", SaveFormat.Docx, result);
AsposeOcr.SaveMultipageDocument(RunExamples.GetDataDir_OCR() + "sample.txt", SaveFormat.Text, result);
AsposeOcr.SaveMultipageDocument(RunExamples.GetDataDir_OCR() + "sample.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf, result);
AsposeOcr.SaveMultipageDocument(RunExamples.GetDataDir_OCR() + "sample.xlsx", SaveFormat.Xlsx, result);
```

Choose your desired format (Docx, Text, Pdf, or Xlsx) and save the OCR results as a multipage document.
