# Create searchable pdf with batch OCR – C# Guide

Ever needed to **create searchable pdf** files from a mountain of scanned images but felt stuck at the first step? You're not alone—most developers hit the same wall when dealing with messy scans, uneven pages, or just plain old bulk conversion.  

The good news? With Aspose OCR you can spin up a **batch OCR processing** pipeline that not only **convert images to pdf** but also **preprocess images for OCR** and even **deskew scanned documents** automatically. In this tutorial we’ll walk through the whole thing, from setting up the engine to polishing the output, so you can run it on a folder of files and walk away with searchable PDF/A‑2b gems.

> **What you’ll get:** a single, runnable C# console app that takes a directory of images (or PDFs), cleans each page, runs OCR, and drops a searchable PDF/A‑2b file next to the source. No piecemeal snippets, just one coherent solution.

---

## Prerequisites

- .NET 6 SDK or later (the code compiles with .NET Core as well).  
- An Aspose OCR NuGet package (`Aspose.OCR`).  
- A folder of scanned images (TIFF, JPEG, PNG) or PDFs you want to turn into searchable PDFs.  
- (Optional) A real license key—otherwise the trial mode will add a watermark, but it works for testing.

If you’ve got those, let’s dive in.

---

## Overview – How the whole pipeline creates a searchable pdf

1. **Activate trial mode** (or load your license).  
2. **Configure `OcrBatchProcessor`** – tell it where to read files, where to write PDFs, which format to use, and how many threads to run in parallel.  
3. **Pre‑process each image** – deskew, denoise, and strip backgrounds so the OCR engine sees a clean page.  
4. **Run the batch** – Aspose processes every file, runs OCR, and writes a searchable PDF/A‑2b.  
5. **Notify completion** – a simple console message, but you could hook a logger or webhook.

That’s the high‑level flow. The code below implements each step with plenty of comments, so you can tweak any part without breaking the whole thing.

---

## Step 1 – Activate trial mode (or load your license)

Before you can call any Aspose class you need to let the library know you’re licensed. For quick experiments the trial mode is enough.

```csharp
using Aspose.OCR;
using Aspose.OCR.Models;
using Aspose.OCR.Filters;
using Aspose.OCR.Batch;

// Activate trial mode – replace with OcrEngine.SetLicense("YourLicenseFile.lic") for production
OcrEngine.EnableTrialMode();
```

> **Pro tip:** keep the license activation at the very top of `Program.cs`. If you forget, the engine will throw an exception the first time you call `Process()`.

---

## Step 2 – Configure the batch OCR processing engine

Here’s where we set up the **batch OCR processing** object. Notice the `InputFolder` and `OutputFolder` are the same in this example, but you can split them if you prefer.

```csharp
// Define where your source images live and where the searchable PDFs should be saved
var ocrBatch = new OcrBatchProcessor
{
    // Folder that contains the images or PDFs to be processed
    InputFolder = @"C:\Scans\Incoming",

    // Folder where searchable PDF/A‑2b files will be saved
    OutputFolder = @"C:\Scans\Processed",

    // Choose the output format – searchable PDF/A‑2b (perfect for archiving)
    OutputFormat = SaveFormat.SearchablePdf,

    // Limit the number of concurrent OCR operations to avoid CPU spikes
    MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 3,

    // Pre‑process each image: deskew, denoise, and remove background
    Preprocess = img => ImageFilters
                            .Deskew(img)          // fixes rotated pages
                            .Denoise()            // reduces speckles
                            .RemoveBackground()   // clears colored backgrounds
};
```

### Why these settings matter

- **`MaxDegreeOfParallelism`**: Running too many OCR threads can saturate your CPU, especially on a modest workstation. Three threads is a sweet spot for most quad‑core laptops.  
- **`Preprocess` pipeline**: The three filters together dramatically improve OCR accuracy. Deskew corrects the common “tilted scan” problem, denoise removes random noise, and background removal ensures the engine sees only black‑on‑white text.  
- **`SaveFormat.SearchablePdf`**: This creates PDF/A‑2b files that are both archival‑ready and searchable—a requirement for many compliance standards.

---

## Step 3 – Execute the batch and watch the magic happen

Running the batch is as simple as calling `Process()`. The method blocks until every file is done, then returns. If you need progress reporting you can hook the `ProgressChanged` event (not shown here).

```csharp
// Start processing – this will walk through every file in InputFolder
ocrBatch.Process();

// Let the user (or calling script) know we’re finished
Console.WriteLine("All files processed. Searchable PDFs are ready.");
```

When the console prints the final line, you’ll find a searchable PDF for each input image in `C:\Scans\Processed`. Open any of them in Adobe Reader, hit **Ctrl+F**, and you can search the text that was just extracted from the scan.

---

## Step 4 – Full runnable program (copy‑paste ready)

Below is the **complete, self‑contained** program you can drop into a new console project (`dotnet new console`). Make sure you’ve added the Aspose.OCR NuGet package first (`dotnet add package Aspose.OCR`).

```csharp
// Program.cs
using Aspose.OCR;
using Aspose.OCR.Models;
using Aspose.OCR.Filters;
using Aspose.OCR.Batch;

namespace CreateSearchablePdfDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // 1️⃣ Activate trial mode (replace with real license for production)
            OcrEngine.EnableTrialMode();

            // 2️⃣ Configure batch OCR processing
            var ocrBatch = new OcrBatchProcessor
            {
                InputFolder = @"C:\Scans\Incoming",   // 👉 change to your source folder
                OutputFolder = @"C:\Scans\Processed", // 👉 change to your target folder
                OutputFormat = SaveFormat.SearchablePdf,
                MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 3,
                Preprocess = img => ImageFilters
                                        .Deskew(img)          // fixes rotated pages
                                        .Denoise()            // cleans up noise
                                        .RemoveBackground()   // strips colored backgrounds
            };

            // 3️⃣ Run the batch
            ocrBatch.Process();

            // 4️⃣ Notify completion
            Console.WriteLine("All files processed. Searchable PDFs are ready.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Expected output

```
All files processed. Searchable PDFs are ready.
```

After the run, navigating to `C:\Scans\Processed` will reveal a set of `.pdf` files—each one searchable, each one PDF/A‑2b compliant. Open any file, type a word you know appears in the original scan, and voilà, the text is highlighted.

---

## Common questions & edge‑case handling

### What if my source folder contains PDFs already?

Aspose OCR can ingest PDFs directly; it will rasterize each page, apply the same **preprocess** filters, and embed the OCR layer. No extra code needed.

### How do I change the output format to a plain PDF (non‑searchable)?

Swap `SaveFormat.SearchablePdf` with `SaveFormat.Pdf`. You’ll lose the searchable text layer, but the visual fidelity stays the same.

### My scans are in color—does background removal affect that?

`RemoveBackground()` targets non‑white backgrounds while preserving the main text. If you need to keep color graphics, you can omit that filter:

```csharp
.Preprocess = img => ImageFilters.Deskew(img).Denoise()
```

### I’m running on a server with limited RAM—can I lower the thread count?

Absolutely. Set `MaxDegreeOfParallelism` to `1` or `2`. The batch will take longer, but memory usage will stay low.

## Conclusion

You now have a **complete, production‑ready** solution to **create searchable pdf** files from any batch of scanned images. By leveraging **batch OCR processing**, you can **convert images to pdf**, **preprocess images for OCR**, and automatically **deskew scanned documents**—all with just a few lines of C#.

Next steps? Try adding a custom naming scheme, hook up a logging framework to capture OCR confidence scores, or experiment with other `ImageFilters` like `Sharpen()` for faint text. The Aspose OCR API is flexible enough to grow with your needs.

Happy coding, and may your PDFs always be searchable!
