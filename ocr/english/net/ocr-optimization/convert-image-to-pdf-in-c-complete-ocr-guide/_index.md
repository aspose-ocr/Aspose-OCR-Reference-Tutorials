# Convert Image to PDF in C# – Complete OCR Guide

Ever needed to **convert image to PDF** but also wanted the text inside to be searchable? You're not the only one. Many developers hit the same wall when dealing with scanned pages, especially those written in Korean. The good news is that with Aspose OCR you can **preprocess image for OCR**, **recognize Korean text image**, and finally **create searchable PDF image** in just a handful of lines.

In this tutorial we’ll walk through the entire pipeline—from loading a raw JPEG of a Korean book page, cleaning it up, extracting the text, and wrapping everything up as a searchable PDF. By the end you’ll have a ready‑to‑run C# console app that you can drop into any .NET project.

## What You’ll Need

- **.NET 6.0 or later** (the code works on .NET Core and .NET Framework alike)  
- **Aspose.OCR for .NET** NuGet package (`Aspose.OCR`) – free trial keys are available on the Aspose site.  
- A sample image containing Korean text (e.g., `korean_book_page.jpg`).  
- A development environment of your choice (Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider – I’m using VS 2022).

> **Pro tip:** Keep your image files in a dedicated folder like `Resources/` so the path stays consistent across machines.

## Overview of the Process

1. **Initialize the OCR engine** with GPU support for speed.  
2. **Add preprocessing filters** (deskew, denoise) to improve recognition accuracy.  
3. **Download and load the Korean language model** – Aspose does this automatically if needed.  
4. **Run the recognition** on the input image.  
5. **Export the result as a searchable PDF** using the built‑in exporter.  
6. **Optionally, serialize the result to JSON** for further analysis or logging.

Below we’ll break each step down, explain *why* it matters, and give you the exact code you can copy‑paste.

## ## Convert Image to PDF – Full Workflow

The following snippet is the *complete* program. Feel free to create a new console project (`dotnet new console -n OcrPdfDemo`) and replace the autogenerated `Program.cs` with this code.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.OCR;
using Aspose.OCR.Filters;
using Aspose.OCR.Export;
using Aspose.OCR.Result;   // for JsonResult

namespace OcrPdfDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // -----------------------------------------------------------------
            // Step 1: Initialise the OCR engine (GPU enabled, offline mode off)
            // -----------------------------------------------------------------
            var ocrEngine = new OcrEngine
            {
                UseGpu = true,          // leverages your graphics card for faster inference
                OfflineMode = false    // allows on‑the‑fly language model download
            };

            // --------------------------------------------------------------
            // Step 2: Add preprocessing filters to improve accuracy
            // --------------------------------------------------------------
            // Deskew corrects slight rotations; MaxAngle = 12° is a safe default.
            ocrEngine.Filters.Add(new DeskewFilter { MaxAngle = 12 });

            // Denoise removes isolated speckles that often appear in scanned books.
            ocrEngine.Filters.Add(new DenoiseFilter());

            // --------------------------------------------------------------
            // Step 3: Load the Korean language model
            // --------------------------------------------------------------
            // Aspose will download the model the first time you run this on a new machine.
            ocrEngine.LoadLanguage(LanguageModel.Korean);

            // --------------------------------------------------------------
            // Step 4: Recognise text from the input image
            // --------------------------------------------------------------
            // Replace the path with your actual image location.
            string imagePath = "Resources/korean_book_page.jpg";
            var recognitionResult = ocrEngine.Recognize(imagePath);

            // --------------------------------------------------------------
            // Step 5: Export the recognised page as a searchable PDF
            // --------------------------------------------------------------
            string pdfPath = "Resources/korean_page.pdf";
            var exporter = new SearchablePdfExporter { OutputPath = pdfPath };
            exporter.Export(ocrEngine, imagePath);

            // --------------------------------------------------------------
            // Step 6: Obtain a structured JSON representation of the result
            // --------------------------------------------------------------
            string json = JsonResult.FromRecognitionResult(recognitionResult).ToString(true);
            Console.WriteLine("=== OCR JSON Result ===");
            Console.WriteLine(json);

            Console.WriteLine("\n✅ Conversion complete!");
            Console.WriteLine($"PDF saved to: {pdfPath}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Why This Works

- **GPU acceleration** cuts the recognition time roughly in half compared to CPU‑only mode.  
- **Deskew** and **Denoise** are classic *preprocess image for OCR* techniques; they correct common scanning defects that otherwise cause the engine to miss characters.  
- **Language model loading** is essential for **recognize Korean text image** – without the Korean model the engine would fall back to a generic Latin alphabet and produce garbage.  
- The **SearchablePdfExporter** bundles the original bitmap and an invisible text layer, giving you a **create searchable pdf image** result that you can index in any PDF viewer.

## ## Preprocess Image for OCR – Tips & Tricks

While the two filters we added are usually enough, you might encounter stubborn images. Here are a few extra steps you can try:

| Issue | Additional Filter | How to Add |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Low contrast | `ContrastFilter { Level = 30 }` | `ocrEngine.Filters.Add(new ContrastFilter { Level = 30 });` |
| Heavy background noise | `BinarizationFilter { Threshold = 128 }` | `ocrEngine.Filters.Add(new BinarizationFilter { Threshold = 128 });` |
| Mixed orientation (portrait & landscape) | `OrientationFilter()` | `ocrEngine.Filters.Add(new OrientationFilter());` |

> **Note:** Adding too many filters can slow down processing. Test each change on a single page before scaling up.

## ## Recognize Korean Text Image – Common Pitfalls

Korean scripts contain Hangul syllables that are visually dense. If you notice garbled output:

1. **Ensure the language model is fully downloaded** – check the console for a message like “Downloading Korean model…”.  
2. **Increase the `MaxAngle`** in `DeskewFilter` if your scans are rotated beyond 12°.  
3. **Boost GPU memory** by setting `ocrEngine.GpuMemoryLimit = 2048;` (value in MB).  

These adjustments directly influence the success of **recognize Korean text image**.

## ## Create Searchable PDF Image – Verifying the Result

After the program finishes, open `korean_page.pdf` in any PDF reader (Adobe Acrobat Reader, Foxit, even Chrome). You should be able to:

- **Select text** with your mouse as if it were a native PDF.  
- **Search** for Korean words using the built‑in search box.  

If the text layer appears blank, double‑check that the `Export` method received the correct image path and that the OCR result contains non‑empty `RecognitionResult.Text`.

---

## ## Full JSON Output – What to Expect

The console prints a nicely formatted JSON payload. A trimmed example looks like this:

```json
{
  "Text": "첫 번째 페이지의 내용...",
  "Blocks": [
    {
      "Text": "첫 번째 페이지의 내용...",
      "BoundingBox": { "X": 12, "Y": 34, "Width": 560, "Height": 780 },
      "Confidence": 0.98
    }
  ],
  "Language": "Korean",
  "ProcessingTimeMs": 842
}
```

You can feed this JSON into downstream services (e.g., indexing pipelines, translation APIs) without having to re‑run OCR.

## ## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: My PDF is huge compared to the original image.**  
A: The exporter embeds the original bitmap at its native resolution. If size is a concern, downscale the image *before* recognition:

```csharp
ocrEngine.Filters.Add(new ResizeFilter { MaxWidth = 1240, MaxHeight = 1754 });
```

**Q: The OCR returns empty strings.**  
A: Verify that the image path is correct and that the file is not corrupted. Also, make sure the GPU driver is up‑to‑date; older drivers can cause silent failures.

**Q: Can I process multiple pages in a loop?**  
A: Absolutely. Wrap steps 4‑6 in a `foreach (var file in Directory.GetFiles("Resources", "*.jpg"))` loop and change the output PDF path accordingly.

## ## Conclusion

We’ve just **converted image to PDF** while preserving searchable text, all thanks to Aspose OCR’s powerful pipeline. By **preprocess image for OCR**, you boost accuracy; by **recognize Korean text image**, you handle complex scripts; and by **create searchable pdf image**, you get a portable, indexable document.

Grab the code, point it at your own scans, and experiment with additional filters or language models. The same pattern works for Chinese, Japanese, or any Latin‑based language—just swap out `LanguageModel.Korean` for the appropriate enum.
