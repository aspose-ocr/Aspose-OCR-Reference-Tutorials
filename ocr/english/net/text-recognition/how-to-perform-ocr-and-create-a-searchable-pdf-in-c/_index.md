# How to Perform OCR and Create a Searchable PDF in C#

Ever needed to **perform OCR** on a scanned document but weren’t sure how to turn the result into a searchable PDF? You’re not alone—many developers hit that roadblock when dealing with legacy TIFF archives or image‑only PDFs. The good news? With a few lines of C# and the Aspose.OCR library, you can convert a TIFF or any image into a fully searchable PDF in a matter of seconds.

In this tutorial we’ll walk through everything you need to know: from installing the library, loading a multi‑page TIFF, to calling `RecognizeToPdf` so you can **convert PDF using OCR** and **make searchable PDF** files that your users can actually search. By the end, you’ll have a ready‑to‑run console app that produces a searchable PDF from an image source.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 6.0** or later (the code also works on .NET Framework 4.7+).
- A valid **Aspose.OCR** license or a temporary evaluation key (the free trial is sufficient for testing).
- Visual Studio 2022 (or any editor you prefer) with the **NuGet** package manager.
- An input file named `input.tif` placed in a folder you control—multi‑page TIFFs work out of the box.

> **Pro tip:** If you’re on Windows, copy the TIFF into the same folder as the compiled `.exe` to avoid path‑related headaches.

## Step 1: Install the Aspose.OCR NuGet Package

Open your project folder in a terminal and run:

```bash
dotnet add package Aspose.OCR
```

This pulls the latest stable version (as of February 2026 it’s 23.10) and adds all required dependencies. After the restore finishes, you’ll see `Aspose.OCR` listed under **Dependencies** in Solution Explorer.

## Step 2: Create a Minimal Console Application

Create a new console project if you don’t already have one:

```bash
dotnet new console -n OcrSearchablePdfDemo
cd OcrSearchablePdfDemo
```

Replace the autogenerated `Program.cs` with the complete code shown in **Step 3**. The program will:

1. Instantiate the OCR engine.
2. Load the source image (or multi‑page TIFF).
3. Run OCR and write the output directly to a searchable PDF.
4. Notify the user that the process succeeded.

## Step 3: Full Working Code – From Image to Searchable PDF

Below is the **entire** source file. Copy‑paste it into `Program.cs`. Comments are included to explain the non‑obvious parts.

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.OCR;          // Core OCR namespace
using Aspose.OCR.Image;   // Provides ImageStream helpers

namespace OcrSearchablePdfDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // -------------------------------------------------
            // 1️⃣ Initialise the OCR engine.
            // -------------------------------------------------
            // The Engine class is the entry point for all OCR operations.
            // You can optionally pass a license object here if you have one.
            var ocrEngine = new Engine();

            // -------------------------------------------------
            // 2️⃣ Load the source image.
            // -------------------------------------------------
            // ImageStream.FromFile supports TIFF, PDF, JPEG, PNG, etc.
            // For multi‑page TIFFs the stream automatically contains all pages.
            string inputPath = "YOUR_DIRECTORY/input.tif";
            var imageStream = ImageStream.FromFile(inputPath);

            // -------------------------------------------------
            // 3️⃣ Perform OCR and write a searchable PDF.
            // -------------------------------------------------
            // RecognizeToPdf does the heavy lifting:
            // • It runs the OCR engine on every page.
            // • It embeds the extracted text as an invisible layer.
            // • The visual appearance of the original image is preserved.
            string outputPath = "YOUR_DIRECTORY/searchable.pdf";
            ocrEngine.RecognizeToPdf(imageStream, outputPath);

            // -------------------------------------------------
            // 4️⃣ Inform the user.
            // -------------------------------------------------
            Console.WriteLine("Searchable PDF created at: " + outputPath);
        }
    }
}
```

**What you’ll see:** After running the program, a file called `searchable.pdf` appears in the target folder. Open it in Adobe Reader or any PDF viewer and try searching for a word that exists in the original TIFF. The text should be found instantly, proving you successfully **made searchable PDF** from an image.

### Running the App

```bash
dotnet run
```

If everything is set up correctly you’ll get:

```
Searchable PDF created at: YOUR_DIRECTORY/searchable.pdf
```

Open the PDF, hit `Ctrl+F`, type a word from the source, and watch the highlight jump to the correct location.

## Step 4: Common Variations and Edge Cases

### Converting a Regular PDF (image‑only) to Searchable PDF

If your source is a PDF that contains scanned images rather than text, you can still use the same method—just change the `ImageStream` source:

```csharp
var pdfStream = ImageStream.FromFile("YOUR_DIRECTORY/input.pdf");
ocrEngine.RecognizeToPdf(pdfStream, "YOUR_DIRECTORY/searchable_from_pdf.pdf");
```

That satisfies the **convert pdf using OCR** scenario without any extra code.

### Handling Large Multi‑Page Documents

For documents exceeding a few hundred pages, consider:

- **Increasing memory limits** (`Engine.MemoryLimit = 2_000; // MB`).
- **Processing in chunks**: load a subset of pages, write intermediate PDFs, then merge them using a PDF library (e.g., Aspose.PDF).

### Dealing with Languages Other Than English

Aspose.OCR supports many languages out of the box. Set the language before recognition:

```csharp
ocrEngine.Language = OcrLanguage.French; // or OcrLanguage.Spanish, etc.
```

If you need **tiff to searchable pdf** in a non‑Latin script, make sure the appropriate language pack is installed.

### What If the Output PDF Is Blank?

- Verify that the input file isn’t corrupted.
- Ensure the OCR engine has a valid license—evaluation mode may impose page limits.
- Check that the image resolution is at least 300 dpi; lower resolutions can cause poor recognition.

## Step 5: Verifying the Result Programmatically (Optional)

Sometimes you want to confirm that the PDF indeed contains a text layer. You can use Aspose.PDF to extract text:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;

var pdfDoc = new Document("YOUR_DIRECTORY/searchable.pdf");
string extracted = pdfDoc.Pages[1].ExtractText();
Console.WriteLine("First page text snippet: " + extracted.Substring(0, 100));
```

If `extracted` is non‑empty, you’ve successfully **made searchable pdf**.

## Conclusion

We’ve covered **how to perform OCR** on a TIFF (or any image) and seamlessly **convert PDF using OCR** to create a **searchable PDF** that behaves like a native document. The key steps are:

1. Install Aspose.OCR.  
2. Initialise `Engine`.  
3. Load the image via `ImageStream`.  
4. Call `RecognizeToPdf`.  

From there you can experiment with language settings, large batch processing, or combine the output with other PDF manipulation tasks. The same pattern works for **tiff to searchable pdf**, **searchable pdf from image**, and even scanned PDFs.

Ready for the next challenge? Try embedding OCR into a web API so users can upload scans and receive searchable PDFs instantly, or explore OCR on handwritten notes using the `OcrEngine`’s advanced settings. The possibilities are endless—happy coding!
