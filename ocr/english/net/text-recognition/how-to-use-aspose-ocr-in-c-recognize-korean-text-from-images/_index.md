# How to Use Aspose OCR in C# – Recognize Korean Text from Images

Ever wondered **how to use Aspose** to pull Korean characters out of a photo? Maybe you have a screenshot of a street sign, a scanned receipt, or a meme that you need to turn into searchable text. The good news is that Aspose OCR makes this a piece of cake, and you don’t have to wrestle with low‑level image‑processing tricks.

In this tutorial we’ll walk through a **complete, runnable example** that shows you how to **convert image text**, **extract text image**, and specifically **extract Korean text** using the Aspose OCR library. By the end you’ll have a console app that prints the recognized Korean string, and you’ll understand why each line matters.

## What You’ll Need

- **.NET 6+** (any recent .NET SDK works – Visual Studio, Rider, or the `dotnet` CLI)
- **Aspose.OCR for .NET** NuGet package  
  ```bash
  dotnet add package Aspose.OCR
  ```
- An image file that contains Korean characters (e.g., `korean_sign.jpg`).  
- A tiny bit of C# knowledge – if you’ve written a “Hello World” before you’re good to go.

> **Pro tip:** Aspose OCR supports over 50 languages out of the box. We’ll focus on Korean because its Hangul script often trips up generic OCR engines.

## Step 1 – Install and Reference Aspose OCR

First, add the library to your project. The NuGet command above does the heavy lifting, but if you prefer the UI, just search for *Aspose.OCR* in the NuGet Package Manager.

```csharp
// No code needed here – the package reference is enough.
// The using directives below will bring the types into scope.
using Aspose.OCR;
using Aspose.OCR.Models;
```

> **Why this matters:** The `using` statements give you access to `OcrEngine`, `Language`, and the `Image` helper class. Without them the compiler would complain about unknown types.

## Step 2 – Load the Image You Want to Process

Aspose OCR works with its own `Image` wrapper, which can read JPEG, PNG, BMP, and many other formats. Point it at the file that holds the Korean text.

```csharp
// Step 2: Load the image containing Korean characters
var imagePath = Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, "korean_sign.jpg");
var image = Image.Load(imagePath);
```

If the file isn’t in the same folder as your executable, adjust the path accordingly. The `Image.Load` call does **convert image text** into an internal representation that the OCR engine can understand.

## Step 3 – Configure the OCR Engine for Korean

The engine needs to know which language to look for; otherwise it defaults to English and will miss Hangul characters.

```csharp
// Step 3: Create and configure the OCR engine
var ocrEngine = new OcrEngine
{
    // Tell Aspose we want to recognize Korean (Hangul)
    Language = Language.Korean
};
```

> **Why this matters:** Setting `Language = Language.Korean` tells the engine to load the Korean language pack, which dramatically improves accuracy for Hangul glyphs. Skipping this step often results in garbled output.

## Step 4 – Run the Recognition Process

Now we actually ask Aspose to read the image. The `Recognize` method returns an `OcrResult` object that contains the extracted string and confidence scores.

```csharp
// Step 4: Run OCR on the loaded image
OcrResult ocrResult = ocrEngine.Recognize(image);
```

If you need to **extract text image** from a larger photo (say, a screenshot with multiple UI elements), you could first crop the region of interest using `image.Crop(...)` before calling `Recognize`. That’s a handy trick when you only care about a specific part of the picture.

## Step 5 – Output the Recognized Korean Text

Finally, display the result. In a real‑world app you might store it in a database or feed it to a translation API, but for this tutorial a console write‑out keeps things simple.

```csharp
// Step 5: Print the recognized Korean text
Console.WriteLine("Recognized Korean text:");
Console.WriteLine(ocrResult.Text);
```

### Expected Output

```
Recognized Korean text:
서울특별시 강남구 테헤란로 123
```

Your actual output will, of course, reflect whatever Korean characters were present in `korean_sign.jpg`.

## Full Working Example

Below is the **complete program** you can copy‑paste into a new console project (`dotnet new console`). Make sure the image file sits next to the compiled `.exe` or adjust the path.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.OCR;
using Aspose.OCR.Models;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // 1️⃣ Install Aspose.OCR via NuGet before running this code.

        // 2️⃣ Load the image that contains Korean text.
        var imagePath = Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, "korean_sign.jpg");
        var image = Image.Load(imagePath);

        // 3️⃣ Create the OCR engine and set it to recognize Korean.
        var ocrEngine = new OcrEngine
        {
            Language = Language.Korean   // 👈 This enables Hangul support.
        };

        // 4️⃣ Run the OCR process.
        OcrResult ocrResult = ocrEngine.Recognize(image);

        // 5️⃣ Output the extracted Korean string.
        Console.WriteLine("Recognized Korean text:");
        Console.WriteLine(ocrResult.Text);
    }
}
```

Run the program with `dotnet run` and watch the Korean characters appear in your console.

## Common Questions & Edge Cases

### What if the OCR returns garbled characters?

- **Check the language setting.** Forgetting `Language.Korean` is the most common mistake.
- **Improve image quality.** Sharper images, higher DPI, and proper lighting boost accuracy.
- **Pre‑process the image.** Aspose OCR offers built‑in filters (`image.Binarize()`, `image.Deskew()`) that can clean up noisy scans.

### Can I **convert image text** in bulk?

Absolutely. Wrap the steps above in a `foreach` loop that iterates over a folder of images. Here’s a quick snippet:

```csharp
foreach (var file in Directory.GetFiles(@"C:\KoreanImages", "*.jpg"))
{
    var img = Image.Load(file);
    var result = ocrEngine.Recognize(img);
    File.WriteAllText(Path.ChangeExtension(file, ".txt"), result.Text);
}
```

This script **extracts text image** from every file and writes a `.txt` file side‑by‑side.

### How do I handle multiple languages in the same image?

Aspose OCR can auto‑detect language if you set `Language = Language.Auto`. However, auto‑detect may be slower and slightly less accurate than specifying the exact language. If you know the image contains both Korean and English, you could run two passes—first with `Language.Korean`, then with `Language.English`—and concatenate the results.

## Tips for Production‑Ready OCR

- **Cache the OcrEngine.** Creating a new engine for every request adds overhead. Keep a singleton if you’re processing many images.
- **Limit image size.** Large images consume memory; downscale to ~1500 px width before feeding them to the engine.
- **Handle exceptions.** Wrap the `Recognize` call in a try/catch to gracefully deal with corrupted files.

## Conclusion

We’ve just covered **how to use Aspose** to **convert image text**, **extract text image**, and specifically **extract Korean text** with a few lines of C# code. The steps are straightforward:

1. Install Aspose OCR.  
2. Load your image.  
3. Configure the engine for Korean.  
4. Run `Recognize`.  
5. Output the result.

Now you can plug this snippet into larger workflows—batch processing, document archival, or even real‑time translation apps. Want to go further? Try adding Aspose’s `Image.Preprocess()` methods, experiment with different languages, or integrate the output with Azure Cognitive Services for translation.
