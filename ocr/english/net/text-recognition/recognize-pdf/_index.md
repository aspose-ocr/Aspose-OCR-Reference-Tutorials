# Recognize PDF in OCR Image Recognition

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Aspose.OCR for .NET! If you're eager to harness the capabilities of OCR in your .NET applications, you're in the right place. In this step-by-step guide, we'll explore how to recognize text in a PDF using the Aspose.OCR library. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, this tutorial will walk you through the process, ensuring that you can easily integrate OCR functionality into your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, let's make sure you have everything you need:

- Aspose.OCR for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.OCR library installed. If not, you can download it from the [Aspose.OCR for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/ocr/net/).

- Document: Prepare the PDF document that you want to perform OCR on. Make sure you have the correct file path.

Now that you're equipped with the necessary tools, let's jump into the tutorial.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET application, import the Aspose.OCR namespace to access the OCR functionality:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.OCR;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Aspose.OCR

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Initialize an instance of AsposeOcr
AsposeOcr api = new AsposeOcr();
```

Here, we set the path to the documents directory and create an instance of the AsposeOcr class.

## Step 2: Provide Image Path

```csharp
// Image Path
string fullPath = dataDir + "multi_page_1.pdf";
```

Specify the path to the PDF document you want to process.

## Step 3: Recognize PDF

```csharp
// Recognize image
List<RecognitionResult> results = api.RecognizePdf(fullPath, new DocumentRecognitionSettings { StartPage = 2, PagesNumber = 2 });
```

Utilize the Aspose.OCR library to recognize text in the PDF document. You can customize recognition settings such as the start page and the number of pages to process.

## Step 4: Print Results

```csharp
// Print result
int pageCounter = 0;
foreach (var result in results)
{
    PrintRecognitionResult(result, pageCounter++);
}
```

Loop through the recognition results and print the extracted text for each page.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully integrated Aspose.OCR for .NET to recognize text in a PDF document. This powerful library opens up a world of possibilities for automating text extraction in your applications.
