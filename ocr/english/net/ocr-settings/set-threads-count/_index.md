# Set Threads Count in OCR Image Recognition

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.OCR for .NET, where cutting-edge Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology meets seamless integration into your .NET applications. In this tutorial, we'll delve into a specific aspect: setting the Threads Count in OCR Image Recognition. This powerful feature optimizes the performance of your OCR tasks, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.OCR for .NET: Ensure that you have the library installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/net/).

- Sample Image: Prepare a sample image in your designated document directory.

Now, let's dive into the steps.

## Import Namespaces

Firstly, make sure to include the necessary namespaces in your .NET application:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.OCR;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Aspose.OCR Instance

Now, initialize an instance of the AsposeOcr class in your application:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Initialize an instance of AsposeOcr
AsposeOcr api = new AsposeOcr();
```

## Step 2: Recognize Image

Next, let's recognize the text in the image using the specified Threads Count:

```csharp
// Recognize image
RecognitionResult result = api.RecognizeImage(dataDir + "sample.png", new RecognitionSettings
{
    ThreadsCount = 2 // 0 - means auto calculate
});
```

## Step 3: Display Recognized Text

After recognition, display the recognized text:

```csharp
// Display the recognized text
Console.WriteLine(result.RecognitionText);
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, setting the Threads Count in OCR Image Recognition using Aspose.OCR for .NET is a straightforward process that significantly enhances performance. Experiment with different thread counts to find the optimal setting for your application.
