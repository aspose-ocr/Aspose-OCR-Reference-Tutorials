# Save Result as Document in OCR Image Recognition

## Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of optical character recognition (OCR) with Aspose.OCR for .NET! In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll delve into the intricacies of using Aspose.OCR to recognize text in images and demonstrate how to save the results as various document formats.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this OCR journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.OCR for .NET. Ensure that you have the Aspose.OCR library installed. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/net/).

- Document Directory: Have a designated directory for your documents, and update the `dataDir` variable in the provided code accordingly.

## Import Namespaces

Begin by importing the necessary namespaces. These are the building blocks that will empower your code with OCR capabilities.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.OCR;
```

Now, let's break down the example into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Initialize Aspose.OCR

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Initialize an instance of AsposeOcr
AsposeOcr api = new AsposeOcr();
```

This step sets the stage by initializing the Aspose.OCR API.

## Step 2: Recognize Image

```csharp
// Recognize image
RecognitionResult result = api.RecognizeImage(dataDir + "sample.png", new RecognitionSettings { });
```

Here, we use Aspose.OCR to recognize text within the specified image (replace "sample.png" with your image file).

## Step 3: Save Result in Different Formats

```csharp
// Save the result in your preferred format
result.Save(RunExamples.GetDataDir_OCR() + "sample.docx", SaveFormat.Docx);
result.Save(RunExamples.GetDataDir_OCR() + "sample.txt", SaveFormat.Text);
result.Save(RunExamples.GetDataDir_OCR() + "sample.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);
result.Save(RunExamples.GetDataDir_OCR() + "sample.xlsx", SaveFormat.Xlsx);
```

Customize this step based on your needs. Aspose.OCR allows you to save the recognized text in various document formats such as DOCX, TXT, PDF, and XLSX.

## Step 4: Display Success Message

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("SaveResultAsDocument executed successfully");
```

A simple confirmation message to let you know that the process was completed without a hitch.

By following these steps, you've successfully harnessed the power of Aspose.OCR for .NET in recognizing text within images and saving the results in different document formats.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Aspose.OCR for .NET opens up a world of possibilities for text recognition in images. Whether you're extracting data or creating searchable documents, Aspose.OCR simplifies the process with its intuitive API.
