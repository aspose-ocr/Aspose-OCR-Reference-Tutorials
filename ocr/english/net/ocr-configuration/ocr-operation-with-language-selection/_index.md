# OCROperation with Language Selection in OCR Image Recognition

## Introduction

In the world of image recognition and optical character recognition (OCR), Aspose.OCR for .NET stands out as a powerful tool for developers seeking accurate and efficient text extraction from images. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of OCR image recognition using Aspose.OCR for .NET, focusing on the operation with language selection.

## Prerequisites

Before we delve into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.OCR for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.OCR library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.OCR for .NET download page](https://releases.aspose.com/ocr/net/).

- Development Environment: Set up a working environment with a .NET application. If you haven't done this yet, refer to the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/ocr/net/) for detailed instructions.

## Import Namespaces

In your .NET application, start by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.OCR;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Aspose.OCR

Begin by initializing an instance of the Aspose.OCR class. This sets the stage for utilizing the OCR capabilities within your application.

```csharp
// ExStart:1
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Initialize an instance of AsposeOcr
AsposeOcr api = new AsposeOcr();
```

## Step 2: Specify Image Path

Next, define the path to the image you want to perform OCR on. Ensure the image is accessible from your application.

```csharp
// Image Path
string fullPath = dataDir + "sample.png";
```

## Step 3: Recognize Image with Language Selection

Now comes the core OCR operation. Utilize the Aspose.OCR library to recognize text from the specified image. Adjust recognition settings, including language selection.

```csharp
// Recognize image           
RecognitionResult result = api.RecognizeImage(fullPath, new RecognitionSettings
{
    DetectAreas = true,
    RecognizeSingleLine = false,
    AutoSkew = true,
    SkewAngle = 0.2F,
    Language = Language.Eng, // Choose the language: none, eng, deu, por, spa, fra, ita, cze, dan, dum, est, fin, lav, lit, nor, pol, rum, srp_hrv, slk, slv, swe, chi
});
```

## Step 4: Print and Display Results

After the OCR operation, print and display the results, including recognized text, areas, warnings, and JSON representation.

```csharp
// Print result
Console.WriteLine($"Text:\n {result.RecognitionText}");
Console.WriteLine("Areas:");
result.RecognitionAreasText.ForEach(a => Console.WriteLine($"{a}"));
Console.WriteLine("Warnings:");
result.Warnings.ForEach(w => Console.WriteLine($"{w}"));
Console.WriteLine($"JSON: {result.GetJson()}");
// ExEnd:1
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully performed OCR image recognition with language selection using Aspose.OCR for .NET. This tutorial demonstrated the essential steps for extracting text from images and highlighted the flexibility of language options.
