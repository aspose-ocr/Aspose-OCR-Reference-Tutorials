# Extract Text from Images Using Aspose.OCR

If you need to **extract text from images** quickly and accurately, Aspose.OCR provides a robust set of APIs that work across .NET, Java, and many other platforms. This tutorial‑style hub walks you through everything you need to know—from initial setup to advanced OCR techniques—so you can integrate powerful text‑recognition capabilities into your applications with confidence.

## Quick Answers
- **What does Aspose.OCR do?** It converts raster images (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc.) into searchable, editable text.  
- **Which languages are covered?** .NET and Java tutorials are available, each with code snippets and configuration tips.  
- **Do I need a license?** A free trial is provided; a commercial license is required for production use.  
- **Can I handle skewed or rotated images?** Yes—Aspose.OCR includes built‑in skew angle calculation and image pre‑processing.  
- **Is the library continuously updated?** Absolutely—new features and performance improvements are released regularly.

## What is “extract text from images”?
Extracting text from images—often called Optical Character Recognition (OCR)—means analyzing a bitmap image, identifying characters, and outputting them as plain text or searchable PDF. Aspose.OCR handles this process automatically, supporting multiple languages, fonts, and complex layouts.

## Why use Aspose.OCR for extracting text from images?
- **High accuracy** – Advanced recognition algorithms reduce errors, even on low‑quality scans.  
- **Cross‑platform support** – Same API surface for .NET, Java, and other environments.  
- **Rich configuration** – Fine‑tune DPI, language packs, and image preprocessing (e.g., skew correction).  
- **Scalable performance** – Optimized for batch processing and large‑volume workloads.
